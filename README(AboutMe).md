- I currently live in Columbus, Ohio but was born in the great state of Texas (Hook 'Em Horns!). I look forward to engaging with like minded peers in the IT/Cybersecurity space and helping to grow myslef and others within the community. Some of my non-cyber hobbies include video games, snowboarding, and leading an active social life.
